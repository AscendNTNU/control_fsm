# Installation

ROS is required to run ROS nodes. This package is developed using ROS Kinetic, but any version should be sufficient. 
This package can be used in combinations with many other packages. Not all of them are required to run this package.

The most important packages are added to an install bash script, located in the scripts folder.

```
scripts/install_dependencies.sh
```

For use with MOCAP systems, additional dependencies are required, run:

```
scripts/install_mocap_dependencies.sh
```
