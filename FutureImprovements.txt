Some suggestions for improving code quality of the ControlFSM

- Rename and redefine typenames like Request and Command (make it easier too understand)
- Move FSM specific ros subscribers to FSM class (f.eks avoid generating positiondata outside FSM just to move it to FSM afterwards
- Find a better way to share common data like position beween between states - read up on design patterns
- Try to find a better way to handle CMDs (avoid having to manually terminate cmds in every state - will probably lead to bugs). Mabye implement commands in a new method in the state interface, thereby shared by all states?
- Avoid using request for both external and internal events
- Add useful eventhandlers for the different states
    - Will allow more flexible design and make it easier to add features later
- ABORT should be a method in stateinterface, not a request - it should not be manually handled by all states
- Avoid subscribing to topics while flying - should be done as a part of init!
- States should be owned by FSM object
    - It's unsafe to store pointer to fsm object in static state object
        - It relies on that the FSM object ALWAYS will be in scope
